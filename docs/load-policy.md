# Host load policy

At startup the in-game host decides, for each plugin, whether to load it. The inputs are the
user's `state.json`, the plugin's `plugin.json` and DLL, and the running game build (see
[layout.md](layout.md)). Capabilities are a consent prompt and a guardrail, not a sandbox: a
loaded native plugin runs in the game process and can do anything that process can.

## Decision

For each plugin with `enabled: true` in `state.json`, run the checks below in order. The first
failure skips that plugin, logs one line `plugin <id>: <code>: <detail>` and continues with the
next plugin. A failing plugin never stops the game or other plugins.

| # | Code | The plugin is skipped when |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `E_STATE` | `plugin.json` is missing, or the plugin's folder name differs from the manifest `id` |
| 2 | `E_MANIFEST` | `plugin.json` fails [manifest.md](manifest.md) (log the specific manifest reason code) |
| 3 | `E_BUILD` | the running game build is covered by no `game_builds` entry |
| 4 | `E_ABI` | the manifest `abi` is greater than the host's `W2R_ABI_VERSION` |
| 5 | `E_HASH` | the SHA-256 of the DLL differs from `state.json` `sha256` |
| 6 | `E_CAPS` | manifest `capabilities` is not a subset of `approved_capabilities` |
| 7 | `E_TAG` | an already-accepted plugin has the same 4-byte peer tag (the later plugin by id order is refused) |
| 8 | `E_DEP` | a dependency is missing, disabled, failed an earlier check, does not satisfy `version_req`, or is part of a dependency cycle (every member of the cycle fails) |
| 9 | `E_ENTRY` | the DLL cannot be opened or loaded, has no `w2r_plugin_main`, the call faults, or it returns null or a `W2rPlugin` whose `struct_size` is below the version-1 minimum or whose `on_load` is null |
| 10 | `E_LOAD` | `on_load` returns a non-zero status or faults |

Details:

- **Build matching.** A build is `a.b.c.d`. An entry matches when it is equal to the running build,
  or when it is a range and min <= build <= max, compared numerically component by component.
- **Order.** Checks 1 to 7 run for every enabled plugin first. The plugins that passed are then
  loaded in dependency order, ties broken by plugin id (bytewise), and checks 8 to 10 run for each
  plugin at its turn. A plugin whose dependency did **not end up loaded**, for any reason (checks
  1-10, including `E_ENTRY` and `E_LOAD` of the dependency), fails check 8 itself; this propagates
  through chains. A dependency that is loaded must also satisfy `version_req`.
- **Tag refusal is not revisited.** `E_TAG` is decided among plugins that passed checks 1 to 6, by
  id order. If the earlier plugin later fails check 8, 9 or 10, the later one stays refused for this
  launch.
- **Peer tag.** `tag = first 4 bytes of SHA-256(UTF-8 plugin id)` (see [abi.md](abi.md)).
- **No live changes.** `state.json` is read at startup only. The in-game toggle may flip `enabled`
  and takes effect at the next launch. There is no live load or unload in version 1.

## No check-then-swap gap

Hashing the DLL and then loading it by path leaves a window in which the file could be replaced.
The host closes it:

1. Open the DLL with sharing that denies writers and deleters (`FILE_SHARE_READ` only).
2. Hash the file from that handle and compare it with the pin.
3. Call `LoadLibrary` on the same path while the handle is still open, then close it.

The load uses an absolute path and `LoadLibraryExW` with `LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_DLL_LOAD_DIR |
LOAD_LIBRARY_SEARCH_SYSTEM32`, so a DLL the plugin itself depends on is looked up only in the
plugin's own folder and the system folder, never the game folder or the current directory.
Writers cannot touch the file between the hash and the load. This does not protect against malware
running as the same user, which can edit `state.json` as well, or act before the open or after the
load. The pin catches corrupted, half-written and out-of-band-modified files and an
index/package mismatch; the [threat model](threat-model.md) says what it does not cover.

Two limits of the pin, stated so nobody relies on more:

- It covers the `entry` DLL only. A DLL the plugin imports is loaded from the plugin folder
  unhashed, so a half-written helper DLL is not caught, and two players with the same
  fingerprint may run different helper code. The manager (Phase 4) verifies every file of a
  package at install time; a plugin that wants the in-game check for a helper can link it
  statically.
- The open handle pins the file and its parent directory against rename, not a junction or
  symbolic link in the path. Someone who can replace `plugins\<id>` with a link between the
  hash and the load has write access to the host root, which is inside the same-user exclusion.

## Simulation fingerprint

Plugins with `affects_simulation: true` change what the game simulates, so players must agree on
them.

- **Input:** every plugin that is *loaded this session* and either has `affects_simulation: true`
  or was approved `hooks.raw` (a raw hook can change anything, so it is always treated as
  simulation-affecting), as `(id, version, dll sha256)`.
- **Encoding:** sort by `id` (bytewise UTF-8). For each plugin append `id`, `0x00`, `version`,
  `0x00`, then the 32 raw bytes of the DLL SHA-256. Hash the concatenation with SHA-256 and keep the
  first 4 bytes. The empty set gives `00 00 00 00` without hashing. Duplicate ids cannot occur.
- **On the wire:** the 4 bytes go, in that order, into the handshake's 4-byte "simulation" field at
  offset 15 (the little-endian u32 of those bytes). wc2r-plus sends zeros, which equals "no
  simulation-affecting plugins".
- **Strict bit (retired):** handshake capability bit 1 used to mean "this host requires matching
  fingerprints" (`require_matching_plugins`). Nobody sets it any more and it is ignored: removing a
  player without telling them why was unfair, so a mismatch only produces warnings.
- **Policy:** a mismatch is only logged (info level, once per player). Players are not warned and
  nobody is removed: most players will not run the same plugins, so a warning would be noise. The
  fingerprint is still used by features that need identical code on every machine (the observer
  team, replays).
- Implementation: `crates/w2r-core/src/fingerprint.rs` computes it after startup loading
  (`plugins.rs` logs it as `simulation fingerprint <hex> (<ids>)`), `handshake.rs` exchanges and
  compares it ([peer-protocol.md](peer-protocol.md)), and the warnings are listed on the plugin screen and
  logged. A lobby banner is not drawn yet (see docs/PLAN.md, Phase 3 step 1).
- The fingerprint covers plugin identity and binary only, **not plugin settings**. A plugin that
  affects the simulation must not let local settings change it, or must agree them between players
  itself through peer messages; otherwise two players with the same plugin can desync unwarned.
- The fingerprint only detects mismatch. It does not authenticate anyone, and a collision at worst
  misses a warning.

Test vectors: `docs/vectors/fingerprint.json` (fingerprints, order independence, duplicate-id
refusal and peer tags). Run with `bash tools/run_all.sh`.
